Language translator is a program that is used to translate text into multiple languages like Hindi, Kannada,Tamil,Telugu,Malayalam,Urdu,.. etc. 
In my language translator app, users can easily translate text into different languages, copy translated text, and download as a text file doc. 
It is similar to Google Translate.
